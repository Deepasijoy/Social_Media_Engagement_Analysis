![Feature Importance](feature_importance.png)
Predicting social media engagement and uncovering key drivers using feature engineering, EDA, and a Random Forest model.

This project explores a rich, diverse social media dataset to understand what drives engagement. The analysis includes:

Data cleaning & feature engineering: extracting text, mentions, hashtags, timestamps, and behavioral metrics

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): correlations, distributions, and engagement patterns

Machine Learning: Random Forest model to predict engagement and identify key drivers

Feature Importance: revealed that the like-to-impression ratio, impressions, and share ratio are the strongest predictors

Insights & Recommendations: actionable guidance on improving content quality and engagement strategies

This analysis demonstrates an end-to-end workflow from raw data to actionable insights that can drive content strategy and data-driven marketing decisions.
